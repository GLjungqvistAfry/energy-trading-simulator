We haven't found any publicly available datasets that would be useable here,
but we can get some info from
> IggstrÃ¶m, Daniel & Svensson, Pontus, 2019, "Demand-side flexibility in shopping centres".
> https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8987974

There we find the following graph, which shows the daily energy usage profile for a shopping centre:

![Hourly electricity load for a shopping centre](images/commercial_elec_demand.png)

We approximate this profile (see `COMMERCIAL_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMPTION_HOURLY_FACTOR`), and add some noise.
