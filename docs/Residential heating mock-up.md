The purpose of this work is to construct some mock data for the heating of the whole Jonstaka electric village.

This attempt starts from data from Tornet's Vetel채ngden site, which consists of two buildings with a total of 40 apartments, according to https://www.bostadorebro.nu/CM/Templates/Article/general.aspx?cmguid=ca09bd6e-09c0-4c16-8cb2-52e2e0bf8f77.
This data has been slimmed down to a few columns: [vetelangden_slim.csv](../tradingplatformpoc/data/vetelangden_slim.csv)

We use this data, but add some noise to it, so that the data for each agent varies a bit.

The data generation is done as follows:

1. Start from the Vetel채ngden data
2. Every 3 hours, generate a random data point _X<sub>t</sub>_ with _N(1, 0.2<sup>2</sup>)_ distribution.
3. Between these 3 hours, interpolate _X<sub>t</sub>_ linearly.
4. Set the mock data for this house to be the entry for Vetel채ngden, multiplied by _X<sub>t</sub>_.
5. Scale the mock data according to the experiment configuration ("ResidentialSpaceHeatKwhPerYearM2" and "ResidentialHotTapWaterKwhPerYearM2")

So the un-scaled mock data will every 3 hours be different from the original Vetel채ngden data by a factor which is normally distributed with standard deviation 20%.
For one house, the un-scaled mock data looks like this:
